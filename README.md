# Let Him Grill

An autonomous, evidence-first extension of the Grill with Docs workflow for
Codex. It resolves safe, reversible decisions on its own and stops when human
judgment materially changes the outcome.

## Demo

![Let Him Grill resolves reversible choices, stops at a human gate, then invalidates and reassesses a dependent branch after an earlier choice changes.](docs/demo.png)

Six decisions evaluated · five resolved autonomously · one human gate. The
[poster frame](docs/demo-poster.png) provides a static alternative.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add pengusto/let-him-grill -g -a codex -y
```

Start a new Codex task after installation, then invoke `$let-him-grill`.

## Before and after

In five paired planning runs, individual questions fell from 66 to 1 and median
time to a usable plan from 455 to 54 seconds. See the
[protocol, raw transcripts, and limitations](docs/benchmark/RESULTS.md).

## How it works

![Excalidraw-style overview of the Let Him Grill decision and Codex rendering workflow.](docs/how-it-works.svg)

- researches repository code and documentation before asking questions
- recommends an answer for every real decision
- triages every option by fit, risk, effort, and reversibility
- continues through reversible, low-risk choices automatically
- stops at architecture, product, security, cost, and other human gates
- invalidates dependent decisions when an earlier choice changes
- supports compact text output and a persistent interactive decision tree

## Manual installation

Use Git as a fallback when the `skills` CLI is unavailable. Both modes use the
same installation; choose the mode when invoking the skill.

### Global installation

Available in every Codex project for the current user:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
git clone https://github.com/pengusto/let-him-grill.git \
  ~/.agents/skills/let-him-grill
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.agents\skills" | Out-Null
git clone https://github.com/pengusto/let-him-grill.git `
  "$HOME\.agents\skills\let-him-grill"
```

### Project-local installation

Version the skill with one repository:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills
git submodule add https://github.com/pengusto/let-him-grill.git \
  .agents/skills/let-him-grill
```

Start a new Codex task after installation so the skill is discovered.

## Use

### Compact mode

Text-first. State and visualization are created only when branching or revisiting
decisions makes them useful.

```text
Use $let-him-grill in compact mode to stress-test this plan.
Continue autonomously until my decision is required.
```

### Visual mode

Persists decisions in `.grill/decisions.json` and shows the interactive tree at
human gates and after changes.

```text
Use $let-him-grill in visual mode to stress-test this plan.
Continue autonomously until my decision is required.
```

Visual mode uses the Python standard-library backend when available and falls
back to native Codex file and visualization tools otherwise. Both backends
populate the same bundled HTML template, so the interface does not change with
the renderer. To choose explicitly:

```text
Use $let-him-grill in visual mode with the Python backend.
```

```text
Use $let-him-grill in visual mode with the native Codex fallback. Do not use
Python or another runtime.
```

Codex announces `Visual mode · Python backend` or
`Visual mode · Native Codex fallback` before the first decision.

### Automatic mode selection

```text
Use $let-him-grill in the best fitting mode to stress-test this
plan until my decision is required.
```

Codex chooses compact mode for short linear discussions and visual mode for
branching or revisitable decisions. It states the selected mode once. You can
switch modes at any time.

### Finishing the grill

At shared understanding, Codex summarizes confirmed human decisions,
provisional AI choices, assumptions, remaining risks or blockers, and the
ordered implementation plan. It asks for confirmation before implementation.

After confirmation, it updates an existing canonical planning, specification,
or decision document when the repository already uses one or documentation was
requested. It does not create a duplicate plan file by default.

## Safety and requirements

- Codex with skill support
- Node.js with `npx` for the primary installation command
- Git only for the manual installation fallback
- Python 3 recommended for deterministic visual state updates
- no virtual environment, `pip install`, server, or network service

Compact mode works without Python. The native visual fallback applies the same
state and invalidation rules through Codex file tools, but does not have the
Python backend's executable validation. Hosts without inline visualization
support fall back to the same decision content as text.

## Update

Global installation:

```bash
git -C ~/.agents/skills/let-him-grill pull --ff-only
```

Project-local submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge \
  .agents/skills/let-him-grill
```

## Development

```bash
python3 scripts/test_decision_state.py
```

The state engine uses only the Python standard library.
See the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for launch and follow-up work.
User-facing changes are tracked in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
