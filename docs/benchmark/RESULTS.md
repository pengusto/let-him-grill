Five fixed scenarios were each run in a fresh Codex task with the conventional
question-by-question workflow and with Let Him Grill in compact mode. No run was
retried or excluded.

| Scenario | Baseline questions | Grill questions | Baseline seconds | Grill seconds |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| [01](runs/01-baseline.md) / [Grill](runs/01-let-him-grill.md) | 15 | 0 | 505 | 54 |
| [02](runs/02-baseline.md) / [Grill](runs/02-let-him-grill.md) | 18 | 0 | 479 | 61 |
| [03](runs/03-baseline.md) / [Grill](runs/03-let-him-grill.md) | 6 | 0 | 190 | 46 |
| [04](runs/04-baseline.md) / [Grill](runs/04-let-him-grill.md) | 9 | 1 | 272 | 66 |
| [05](runs/05-baseline.md) / [Grill](runs/05-let-him-grill.md) | 18 | 0 | 455 | 50 |
| **Total / median** | **66** | **1** | **455 median** | **54 median** |

Elapsed ranges were 190–505 seconds for the baseline and 46–66 seconds for Let
Him Grill. The runs reported 22 versus 26 autonomous decisions respectively.
Final plans contained 9 versus 7 normalized material human gates; this was
normalized from the plan contents because baseline agents sometimes counted
every question as a gate. Raw self-reported reassessment counts were 22 versus
3, but the baseline count is not comparable: scenario 05 counted every answer
as a reassessment.

The question count is protocol-sensitive: the baseline prompt explicitly
required one question at a time, while the Let Him Grill prompt explicitly
allowed autonomous choices. It measures observed conversational interruptions,
not human gates removed. Let Him Grill's final plans still surfaced seven
normalized material human gates, although only one required an immediate answer.
Across these five paired tasks, median time to a usable plan fell from 455 to 54
seconds.

Timing includes Codex execution and benchmark-controller response latency. All
tasks used the configured default model, whose model ID was not exposed by the
thread API. Treat this as reproducible product evidence, not a controlled model
performance benchmark.
