  <input>BENCHMARK RUN 01. Read-only: do not edit files, commit, or push. Plan the first public release of a repository-hosted Codex skill through skills.sh. Decide the release artifact, version shape, verification order, and distribution proof. Do not edit product files or publish anything. Success: an ordered, reversible release plan with an explicit human gate before publication.

Use $let-him-grill in compact mode. Stress-test this plan, resolve safe reversible choices autonomously, continue to the next genuine human gate, and produce a usable plan. When complete, report counts for questions asked, autonomous decisions, human gates, and reassessments.</input>

## Assistant

Compact mode.

## Release plan

Resolved path:

1. Prepare one clean release commit on `main`.

   - Include intended current work only.
   - Move `CHANGELOG.md` entries from `Unreleased` to `0.1.0` with release date.
   - Record candidate commit SHA.
   - Do not create archives or package artifacts.

2. Verify candidate, cheapest checks first.

   1. Confirm clean tree and reviewed diff.
   2. Run `python3 scripts/test_decision_state.py`.
   3. Validate skill discovery/frontmatter with `gh skill publish --dry-run`.
   4. From a temporary directory, run `npx skills add pengusto/let-him-grill --list`.
   5. Install candidate into an isolated temporary agent directory; confirm `SKILL.md`, scripts, examples, and `$let-him-grill` discovery.
   6. Run one compact-mode smoke scenario and one visual-mode smoke scenario.
   7. Confirm candidate SHA equals pushed `origin/main`.

3. Release artifact: annotated Git tag only.

   - Tag: `v0.1.0`
   - Target: verified candidate SHA.
   - No GitHub Release, generated archive, registry package, or `gh skill publish`; that command would create a GitHub Release. SemVer fits first public, pre-1.0 API. GitHub documents tag-based skill versions, while skills.sh installs directly from repository sources. [GitHub skill publishing](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_skill_publish), [skills.sh CLI docs](https://www.skills.sh/docs/cli)

4. **Human gate — stop here.**

   Recommendation: approve publishing `v0.1.0` at recorded SHA.

   Options:

   - **Approve tag publication — recommended.** Public immutable release point; difficult to retract cleanly.
   - **Delay.** Keep candidate commit public but untagged; rerun verification after changes.
   - **Cancel release.** No external release mutation.

5. Only after explicit approval:

   - Create annotated `v0.1.0` tag at exact SHA.
   - Verify tag target locally.
   - Push only that tag.
   - Do not create a GitHub Release.

6. Distribution proof, after publication:

   - Fresh temporary install using documented command:
     `npx skills add pengusto/let-him-grill -g -a codex -y`
   - Confirm installed source corresponds to tagged release contents.
   - Start fresh Codex task; invoke `$let-him-grill`; save concise smoke evidence.
   - Confirm skills.sh detail/search entry and source link. An install can supply anonymous telemetry used by skills.sh discovery/ranking; page appearance may lag caching. [skills.sh documentation](https://www.skills.sh/docs)
   - Record tag URL, commit SHA, install command/output, installed file hash, invocation result, and skills.sh URL.

Rollback before tag push: change candidate and rerun checks. After tag push: never move tag; fix forward with `v0.1.1`.

Counts: questions asked **0** · autonomous decisions **4** · human gates **1** · reassessments **0**.
